fisrt purpose of computational machines
        compute the bernoulli numbers
ADA - frst programmer
    - first programming language

First usages of computrs:
    - complicated calculations in economics, architectures(buildings)
    - arthematical books with various common computations(formulas, algorithms, sin, cos, etc)

Charles Babbage ideea for computer:
    - first general porpouse computational machines
    - all books had different aproximation of infinite fct -> lets compute a machine that compute mathematical computations
    - promised to build it in 1 year for 1000 pounds, received 17.000 and failed
    - first Differential Engine, then Analytical project an faild again
    - why failure? 
        - technological advancement were poor, no insustrial equipment to produce metlic parts with huge precision for his design        
        - no precision in industry for mechanical part
        - Charles was like Touring like         

Computer Science 
    - 1959
    - Harware -> 1822 with Charles Babbage
        - mechanical computators : 1600
    Software
        - first appeard with Mussamad(Arab) that invented the term ALGORITHM
    - term first appeard in an article by ACM(Association of Computer Machinery)
    - *:        
        - fields:
            - theoretical C.S.(DSA, Coding theory, Languages)
            - computer sistems (operation sistems, DB, Netwoks,)
            - AI, 
            - Softwere Engineering(Design Patterns, reuse of the code)
    - **:
        - algoritmy de numero hyndorum =             
        - numbering systems: invented by Indians, brought by Arabs
